# DAT550 Project:  Analyze Data Around Netflix Shows

## Introduction:

<div align="justify">Netflix is the world’s leading media streaming platform, operating in nearly every country in the world.  It was one of the very first players in the streaming industry when it made the transition in 2007, and the bet has paid off with hundreds of millions of subscribers around the world. The streaming service was initially built on the back of licensed content from other distributors, but Netflix began funding its own original programming in 2013. The first of these all-new “Netflix Originals” was House of Cards, which broke new grounds for streaming-only media [1].<br>
In over 190 countries, Netflix members get instant access to every content available. Netflix content will vary by region, and may change over time. The more users watch the contents, the better Netflix succeeds at recommending TV shows and movies they will enjoy watching.<div/>
